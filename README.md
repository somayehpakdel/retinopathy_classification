# Retinopathy Classification
Millions of people around the world suffer from diabetic retinopathy. In this project, I have used [fundus images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_photography) to classify retinopathy disease. This disease is the leading cause of blindness in adults. Therefore, in this context, eye disease screening is of particular importance.

In this project, I have used fundus images to classify retinopathy disease. The benefits of this project are in helping the screening centers for eye diseases.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project are taken from [APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection) competition in Kaggle.

### Stages Of Diabetic Retinopathy

- NO DR
- Mild
- Moderate
- Servere
- Proliferative DR

## Framework and Model
I've used the [Fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) framework, which is based on PyTorch. Also, I have used transfer learning and Resenet network as pre-trained model.
